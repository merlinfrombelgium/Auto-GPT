 Thank you! Here are the goals you gave me:

1. Create agents following Auto-GPT's logic.
2. These agents will be addressable by name, just like a normal Auto-GPT agent, with the difference being these agents are served through a web service.
3. This web service will run on http://localhost:911.
4. All agent configurations and their activity logs will be stored in your memory so they can be reused.
5. Any agent that has not been active for 5 minutes, will be stopped.

2023-04-15 03:24:44,995 ERROR Error: Invalid JSON
 Understood. To create a web service, we will need to use a web framework. Flask is a popular web framework in Python that we can use. Here is the plan:

- Install Flask using pip
- Create a new Flask app
- Define a route for the web service to accept requests
- Parse incoming requests and return appropriate responses

Here is the code to install Flask:

```
!pip install Flask
```

Once Flask is installed, we can create a new Flask app using the following code:

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
```

Next, we need to define a route for the web service to accept requests. We can use the `@app.route` decorator to define a route. Here is an example route:

```
@app.route('/api', methods=['POST'])
def handle_request():
    data = request.get_json()
    # process the request and generate a response
    response = {'message': 'success'}
    return jsonify(response)
```

This route will accept POST requests to the `/api` endpoint. The request data will be in JSON format and can be accessed using `request.get_json()`. We can then process the request and generate a response. The response should also be in JSON format and can be returned using `jsonify()`.

We can now start the Flask app using the following code:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=911)
```

This will start the Flask app on port 911.

Let me know if you have any questions.
