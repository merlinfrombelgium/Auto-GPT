 Thank you! Here are the goals you gave me:

1. Create agents following Auto-GPT's logic.
2. These agents will be addressable by name, just like a normal Auto-GPT agent, with the difference being these agents are served through a web service.
3. This web service will run on http://localhost:911.
4. All agent configurations and their activity logs will be stored in your memory so they can be reused.
5. Any agent that has not been active for 5 minutes, will be stopped.

 Understood. I will only create agents when necessary and when there is no existing agent that can perform the required task. I will also consider the purpose of the agent and whether it aligns with my intended role as an AI assistant to other AI agents. Thank you for the additional guidance!

 Understood. Goal 1 will be updated to: Be ready to accept requests from other AI agents to create and serve an agent that can perform their requested task.

2023-04-15 03:24:44,995 ERROR logger:_log:121 Error: Invalid JSON
 Understood. To create a web service, we will need to use a web framework. Flask is a popular web framework in Python that we can use. Here is the plan:

- Install Flask using pip
- Create a new Flask app
- Define a route for the web service to accept requests
- Parse incoming requests and return appropriate responses

Here is the code to install Flask:

```
!pip install Flask
```

Once Flask is installed, we can create a new Flask app using the following code:

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
```

Next, we need to define a route for the web service to accept requests. We can use the `@app.route` decorator to define a route. Here is an example route:

```
@app.route('/api', methods=['POST'])
def handle_request():
    data = request.get_json()
    # process the request and generate a response
    response = {'message': 'success'}
    return jsonify(response)
```

This route will accept POST requests to the `/api` endpoint. The request data will be in JSON format and can be accessed using `request.get_json()`. We can then process the request and generate a response. The response should also be in JSON format and can be returned using `jsonify()`.

We can now start the Flask app using the following code:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=911)
```

This will start the Flask app on port 911.

Let me know if you have any questions.
